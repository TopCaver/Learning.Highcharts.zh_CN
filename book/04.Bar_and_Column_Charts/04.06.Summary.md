## 总结
In this chapter we have learned how to use both column and bar charts. We utilized their options to achieve various presentations of columns and bars for the ease of comparison between data. We also advanced the configurations for different chart appearances such as mirror and gauge charts. In the next chapter we will explore the pie chart series.
这一章我们学习了柱状图和条形图。为了方便数据之间的比较，我们利用绘图选项实现各种柱状图和条形图的展示。在镜像图和仪表图中我们还是用了一些高级选项。在下一章我们将探索如何绘制饼图。
